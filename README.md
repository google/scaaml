![SCAAML banner](https://storage.googleapis.com/scaaml-public/visuals/scaaml-banner.png)

SCAAML (Side Channel Attacks Assisted with Machine Learning) is a deep learning framework dedicated to side-channel attacks.
It is written in python and run on top of TensorFlow 2.x.

## Available components

- [`scaaml/`](https://github.com/google/scaaml/tree/master/scaaml/): The SCAAML framework code. Its used by the various tools.
- [`scaaml_intro/`](https://github.com/google/scaaml/tree/master/scaaml_intro): *A Hacker Guide To Deep Learning Based Side Channel Attacks*.
  Code, dataset and models used in our step by step tutorial on how to use deep-learning to perform AES side-channel attacks in practice.

## Install

### Dependencies

To use SCAAML you need to have a working version of [TensorFlow 2.x](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) and a version of Python >=3.6


### SCAAML framework install

1. Clone the repository: `git clone github.com/google/scaaml/`
2. Install the SCAAML package: `python setup.py develop`

### Dataset and models

Every SCAAML component rely on a datasets and optional models that you will need to download in the component directory. The link to download those are available in the components specific README.md. Simply click on the directory representing the component of your choice, or the link to the component in the list above.
