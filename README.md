![SCAAML banner](https://storage.googleapis.com/scaaml-public/visuals/scaaml-banner.png)

SCAAML (Side Channel Attacks Assisted with Machine Learning) is a deep learning
framework dedicated to side-channel attacks. It is written in python and run on
top of TensorFlow 2.x.

## Available components

-   [`scaaml/`](https://github.com/google/scaaml/tree/master/scaaml/): The
    SCAAML framework code. Its used by the various tools.

-   [`scaaml_intro/`](https://github.com/google/scaaml/tree/master/scaaml_intro):
    *A Hacker Guide To Deep Learning Based Side Channel Attacks*.  Code, dataset
    and models used in our step by step tutorial on how to use deep-learning to
    perform AES side-channel attacks in practice.

## Install

### Dependencies

To use SCAAML you need to have a working version of [TensorFlow
2.x](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) and a version of Python >=3.9

### SCAAML framework install

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone github.com/google/scaaml/`
2.  Create and activate Python virtual environment:
       `python3 -m venv my_env`
       `source my_env/bin/activate`
3.  Install dependencies: `python3 -m pip install --require-hashes -r
    requirements.txt`
4.  Install the SCAAML package: `python setup.py develop`

### Update dependencies (maintainers only)

Make sure to have: `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv` and
activated the virtual environment.

Install requirements:
`pip install --require-hashes -r base-tooling-requirements.txt`

Update: `pip-compile --allow-unsafe requirements.in --generate-hashes --upgrade`
and commit `requirements.txt`.

### Dataset and models

Every SCAAML component relies on a dataset and optional models that you will
need to download in the component directory. The links to download these are
available in the component specific `README.md`. Simply click on the directory
representing the component of your choice, or the link to the component in the
list above.
