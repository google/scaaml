Import GPAM model:

```python
from scaaml.models import get_gpam_model
```

A [tinyAES tutorial](https://google.github.io/sedpack/tutorials/sca/gpam/) is
available. It will walk you through
[dataset preparation](https://google.github.io/sedpack/tutorials/sca/dataset/)
using the new [sedpack](https://github.com/google/sedpack) format which is
going to be the next generation of SCAAML data storage. Finally you will train
a GPAM network to on the tinyAES dataset.
