description: Deep Learning Components of SCAAML
---

Some custom components are provided to ease research.  If you are searching for
a specific model code take a look in the "Papers and Presentations" section.

## Overview of parts

-   **Deep learning models:** TODO
    -   Archived code of the first SCAAML demo.
    -   Archived version of the GPAM model.
    -   Import GPAM model `from scaaml.models import get_gpam_model`.
-   **Metrics:** TODO
-   **Intermediates of algorithms:** We provide software implementation of
    algorithms to help with pre-computing intermediates. The following are
    supported:
    -   AES128
-   **Dataset storage:** TODO
