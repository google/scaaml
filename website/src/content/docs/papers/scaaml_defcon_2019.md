title: SCAAML AES side-channel attacks tutorial
description: A tutorial presented at DEF CON 27.
---

The introduction of the SCAAML (Side Channel Attacks Assisted with Machine
Learning) project was at Defcon 27 (2019).  The talk is recorded at the
blogpost [A Hacker Guide To Deep Learning Based Side Channel
Attacks](https://elie.net/talk/a-hackerguide-to-deep-learning-based-side-channel-attacks)
(talk recording and slides).
Two additional blogposts are a walkthrough the code:

-   [Hacker's guide to deep-learning side-channel attacks: the
    theory](https://elie.net/blog/security/hacker-guide-to-deep-learning-side-channel-attacks-the-theory)
    A lightweight introduction to the side-channel attacks theory.
-   [Hacker's guide to deep-learning side-channel attacks: code
    walkthrough](https://elie.net/blog/security/hacker-guide-to-deep-learning-side-channel-attacks-code-walkthrough)
    Annotation for the code available from the
    [scaaml_intro](https://github.com/google/scaaml/tree/main/scaaml_intro).
    Beware that this code is the very first version and has been archived.  If
    you still want to run the original version you might need an older version
    of TensorFlow (2.10 should work) as opposed to what is installed by the
    `requirements.txt` file.  Or even better you might choose to use our newer
    GPAM model.

The archived code (be prepared to use an older version of TensorFlow) can be
found at our: [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/google/scaaml/tree/main/scaaml_intro).
