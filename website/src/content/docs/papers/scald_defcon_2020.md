### A Hacker’s guide to reducing side-channel attack surfaces using deep-learning

At DEF CON 28 &amp; Black Hat USA (2020) a proof of concept of using
explainability to pinpoint leakage sources uncovered by a neural network.  [See
the talk and
slides](https://elie.net/talk/a-hacker-guide-to-side-channel-attack-surface-reduction-using-deep-learning).
