# Generalized Power Attacks against Crypto Hardware using Long-Range Deep Learning

[Full version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07249)

To make cryptographic processors more resilient against side-channel attacks,
engineers have developed various countermeasures. However, the effectiveness of
these countermeasures is often uncertain, as it depends on the complex interplay
between software and hardware. Assessing a countermeasure’s effectiveness using
profiling techniques or machine learning so far requires significant expertise
and effort to be adapted to new targets which makes those assessments expensive.
We argue that including cost-effective automated attacks will help chip design
teams to quickly evaluate their countermeasures during the development phase,
paving the way to more secure chips.

In this paper, we lay the foundations toward such automated system by proposing
GPAM, the first deep-learning system for power side-channel analysis that
generalizes across multiple cryptographic algorithms, implementations, and
side-channel counter-measures without the need for manual tuning or trace
preprocessing. We demonstrate GPAM’s capability by successfully attacking four
hardened hardware-accelerated elliptic-curve digital-signature implementations.
We showcase GPAM’s ability to generalize across multiple algorithms by attacking
a protected AES implementation and achieving comparable performance to
state-of-the-art attacks, but without manual trace curation and within a limited
budget. We release our data and models as an open-source contribution to allow
the community to independently replicate our results and build on them.

## Models

ECC CM1 model code ready for training with our dataset:
[gpam_ecc_cm1.py](https://github.com/google/scaaml/blob/main/papers/2024/GPAM/gpam_ecc_cm1.py).

Trained models: [models](gs://scaaml-public/datasets/ECC/GPAM_MODELS), download
them the same way as datasets [GPAM ECC datasets](https://github.com/google/scaaml/tree/main/papers/datasets/ECC/GPAM).
Beware that for some reason one needs an older version of TensorFlow:

```bash
python3 -m venv gpam_env
source gpam_env/bin/activate
python -m pip install "tensorflow==2.12"
```

```python
import tensorflow as tf

from scaaml.metrics import MeanRank


print(tf.__version__)
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model(
    # path to the model, e.g.,
    # "saved_model_ecc_cm2_ablation_of_intermediates_k_0_1675073027/"
    model_path,
    custom_objects={
        # No need to pass a learning rate schedule since we are not
        # training.
        "CosineDecayWithWarmupSchedule": lambda *args, **kwargs: 0.001,
        "MeanRank": MeanRank,
    },
)
```

## Use with sedpack TODO

How to use with [sedpack](https://github.com/google/sedpack) coming soon (if
you already downloaded the datasets four small json files per dataset will be
needed, if you used `gsutil rsync` to download, these will be downloaded very
fast).

For now see the tutorial
[https://google.github.io/sedpack/tutorials/sca/gpam/](https://google.github.io/sedpack/tutorials/sca/gpam/).

## List of Errata

### Erratum -- April 2025 (last update 24 April 2025)

We thank an anonymous source (we asked for permission to publish their
name(-s)) for pointing us that the ECC CM2 result was not working as expected.
Namely the published model achieved just 2% accuracy as opposed to 20%. This
has been caused by our mistake during publishing the internal version. The fix
is available in [pull request 354](https://github.com/google/scaaml/pull/354).

The changes:

-   Fewer dense layers in the head.
-   BatchNorm instead of ScaledNorm.

The fix has been applied to the current version of GPAM model and one can just

```python
from scaaml.models import get_gpam_model
```

The code of `papers/2024/GPAM/gpam_ecc_cm1.py` has not been modified yet and we
will modify it after we repeat all experiments.

To make sure all main results are repeatable we provide the following script:
`papers/2024/GPAM/train_with_config.py` and configurations based on Table 1 of
[Generalized Power Attacks against Crypto Hardware using Long-Range Deep
Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07249). The main difference is that here
we are using the `Adafactor` optimizer in place of `Adam` with learning rate
schedule. This seems to help to make the training more stable (problem
described under Weight Initialization Influence). The differences are that the
learning rate is set ten times higher that what is reported in Table 1. One
could try to combine `Adafactor` with learning rate schedule to achieve more
precise results. Namely the non-protected ECC CM0 achieves better results with
learning rate decay. See
[Keras Learning rate schedules API](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/learning_rate_schedules/)
for more details.

The results are still work in progress. Note that these were run on an older
computer so the runtime is longer.  Results (accuracy in percent) compared to
Table 4 and 5 (holdout) and Figure 3 (validation) of [Generalized Power Attacks
against Crypto Hardware using Long-Range Deep
Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07249):
