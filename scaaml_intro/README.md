# SCAAML AES side-channel attacks tutorial

This directory provide the code, models and dataset needed to reproduce the AES deep-learning side channel attack
demonstrated at [DEF CON 27](https://elie.net/talk/a-hackerguide-to-deep-learning-based-side-channel-attacks/)
and in our online tutorial.

## Important notes

This dataset and code is **for educational and demo purpose only**.
It is not suitable for research as TinyAES is an easy target and
we don't provide the holdout dataset to do proper evaluations.

If you use this code, models or dataset in any shape or form please provide attribution
by citing our [DEF CON presentation](https://elie.net/talk/a-hackerguide-to-deep-learning-based-side-channel-attacks/) or having a link to this
[repository](https://github.com/google/scaaml).

For research purpose you should instead use, when they will be available, our
large scale benchmark datasets which have a wide variety of targets
with different levels of difficulty and holdout datasets made on
different hardware board to test model generalization.
We will announce it on Twitter, blog and other channels when available.

Finally the models are significantly smaller and yield better results than the
original presentation as they were updated to use one of our latest model
architecture which is significantly more efficient.

## Setup

### Framework install

In order to run the notebooks/train models you need to install the SCAAML framework as described in the main [README](https://github.com/google/scaaml/)

### Dataset & models

In order to run the notebooks/train models you need to download the following dataset and models:

Make sure to unzip them in this directory (`scaaml_demo`) otherwise the code won't find them.

Note: the Tensorboard logs are optional, they are mostly provided for people interested in looking at how fast the models converged.

## Usage

The code is split into two parts:

- `train.py` is used to train the attack models. It takes as argument a config
  that define what to train. The configuration used in the tutorial is located here
  `config/stm32f415_tinyaes.json` and you can use it to train your own models by running
  `python train.py -c config/stm32f415_tinyaes.json`
- `key_recovery_demo.ipynb` is the notebook that showcases how to use the trained model
  and the `scaaml` library to recover TinyAES keys with just 4 traces. You can either use the models provided, or train your own.
