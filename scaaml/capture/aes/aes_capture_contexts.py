        reproducible, ELF binaries are not).

      shortname: Short name of the dataset being captured.
      description: Short description for the scaaml.io.Dataset.
      capture_info (Dict): Used as parameters of the scope. Should contain:
        samples (int): Number of data points in a single capture = length of the
          trace.
        offset (int): How many samples are discarded between the trigger event
          and the start of the trace.
        sample_rate: Sample rate of the scope. When scope_class is PicoScope
          this is float. When scope_class is CWScope this is string and is the
          clock source for cw.ClockSettings.adc_src (see cw documentation).

          while capture (see cw documentation).

        train_chip_id (int): ID of the chip used for train split capture.

          present without the prefix.

      examples_per_shard: Size of a single part (for ML training purposes).

        measured, how many points are taken).
      repetitions: Number of captures with a concrete (key, plaintext) pair.
      train_keys: Number of different keys that are used in the train split (set
        to zero not to capture this split), multiple of 256. Also captures
        test split 12.5% size of train (1/8 keys).
      train_plaintexts: Number of different plaintexts used with each key in
        the train split.

        the holdout split.
