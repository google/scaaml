def single_bunch(length: int,

    """Generate a single bunch of arrays (2D array -- rows * columns). Each row
    has elements chosen uniformly independently from range(elements). But two
    rows have no index where they are equal.

    Rationale: neural networks are very good at picking statistical properties.
    By random chance the value 0x2A of byte 3 (concrete values chosen for
    illustration purposes only) appears more often than others and this is
    consistent in train and valuation set. Then we can get false positives (it
    looks like the neural network is sort of working). Generating the train set
    such that each byte attains each value the same number of times helps to
    mitigate this situation.

    Explanation of the algorithm: for each index we create a random permutation
    of elements and concatenate those, we then return this transposed.

    Beware of doing two for loops over two single_bunch outputs generated with
    the same seed. This would return identical arrays.

    Args:
      length (int): Length of each of the resulting arrays.
      elements (int): Each array contains numbers in `range(elements)`.
      seed (Optional[int]): Seed for the random generator. Passed to
        numpy.random.default_rng. For testing purposes only.

    Returns: an np.array of shape `(elements, length)` where for each index
      `i in range(length)` and for each `value in range(elements)` there is an
      array which contains `value` on position `i`.

    Example use:
      >>> print("Small and deterministic example:")
      >>> single_bunch(5, 3, 42)
      array([[2, 0, 1, 2, 2],
             [1, 2, 2, 0, 0],
             [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]])
      >>> print("Realistic example:")
      >>> for value in single_bunch(32):
      >>>     print(f{value} has each byte chosen uniformly at random)
      >>> print("But no two values had same element on the same position.")

        random arrays).
      elements (int): Each array contains numbers in `range(elements)`.

    Example use: Output may vary based on randomly generated numbers.

    Two bunches examples (generates bunches * elements arrays):

    [0 2 1 0 0]
    >>> print("Each value repeats the same number of times in each column.")
    >>> print("But columns may repeat.")

    AES128 example: for each key have balanced plain_texts (thus SBOX inputs are
    also balanced). Note that length is number of bytes = 16 (128 bits / 8).
    This results in 65,536 traces, 256 different keys and for each key 256
    different plain_texts (for different keys we generate different plain_texts
    at random).

    >>>     for plain_text in balanced_generator(length=16):
    >>>         print(f"Capture trace with {key = } and {plain_text = }")

    AES128-like example (small, output may be different, based on random
    chance):

    >>>         print(f"Capture trace with {key = } and {plain_text = }")
