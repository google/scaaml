        Args:

          samples (int): How many points to sample (length of the capture).

          offset (int): How many samples to discard.

          ip_address (str): IP address or hostname of the oscilloscope.

          trace_channel (LeCroyChannelName): Channel name.

          trigger_channel (LeCroyChannelName): Channel name.

          communication_timeout (float): Timeout communication after
            `communication_timeout` seconds.

          trigger_timeout (float): Number of seconds before the trigger times
            out (in seconds).

          scope_setup_commands (list[dict[str, Any]]): List of commands used
            to set up the scope. There are three possible actions taken in
            the order (command, method, query):

            - { "command": "command string" } The "command string" is sent to
              the scope after being formatted with the following wildcards:
              - `trace_channel=trace_channel`,
              - `trigger_channel=trigger_channel`,
              - `trigger_line=trigger_line`.
              - `samples=samples`.

            - { "method": "method_name", "kwargs": {} } The method is called
              with given kwargs. The supported methods are: `set_trig_delay`.
              This allows to do settings which are dependent on other settings
              (e.g., setting TRIG_DELAY which depends on TIME_DIV) without
              having to change two parameters.

            - { "query": "query string" } The "query string" is sent to
              the scope after being formatted with
              `trace_channel=trace_channel, trigger_channel=trigger_channel`.
              A dictionary of {"query string": "answer"} for all of these can
              be obtained using `get_scope_answers`.

            For convenience the following commands are prepended:
              { "command": "COMM_HEADER OFF", },
              {  # Use full precision of measurements
                  "command": "COMM_FORMAT DEF9,WORD,BIN",
                  "query": "COMM_FORMAT?",
              },
              { "command": "TRMD SINGLE", },  # Trigger mode
              { "command": "AUTO_CALIBRATE OFF", },
              # Center the trace vertically
              { "command": "{trace_channel}:OFFSET 0", },
            and the following is appended:
              {"command": "STOP"}  # Stop any signal acquisition
