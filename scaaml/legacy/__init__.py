"""Software version of the SCAAML library.

Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (see https://pypi.org/project/semver/ for more
  possibilities)

Usage:
  Dataset.from_config (and thus Dataset.get_dataset) are using 'scaaml_version'
  and raise a ValueError if the dataset has been captured with a higher
  version of scaaml.

  When a dataset is loaded and Dataset._write_config is called again then the
  scaaml_version is updated to the current value.

  semver.compare is used to compare two versions of the SCAAML library.
