    """Reshape each shard to have only examples_per_shard. This method
    should not change the original dataset (old_ds).

    Reshaping can take a lot of time and scaaml.io.Dataset is not
    thread-safe yet. One may write a Python script invoking
    reshape_into_new_dataset, call the script multiple times (with
    appropriate values of from_idx and to_idx), and then use
    Dataset.merge_with to merge the resulting reshaped datasets.

    Args:
      examples_per_shard: Number of examples in each shard in the new
        dataset. Needs to divide the old examples_per_shard.
      name_prefix: shortname is prefixed with the string
        f"{name_prefix}_{from_idx}_{to_idx}_" (the resulting dataset should
        not exist).
      from_idx: The index of the first shard that is reshaped (shards with
        indices in range(from_idx, to_idx) are reshaped). This holds for
        each split (it is safe to have to_idx larger than the length of
        shards_list for some/all split).
      to_idx: The index of the first shard that is not reshaped. Zero value
        stands for max(len(old_ds.shards_list[s]) for s in old_ds.shards_list)).
      url: Download URL of the new dataset.

    Raises:
      ValueError: If examples_per_shard does not divide old value of
        examples_per_shard.
      DatasetExistsError: If the new dataset already exists (change the
        name_prefix).

    Returns: The new dataset object.

    Bugs:
      Part id might be too high (max is old_ds.MAX_PART_NUMBER).

      When splitting a single shard, the key info gets distributed to the
      resulting sub-shards. When a shard contains multiple keys, this means
      that the key in the info might not even be present in the shard.
